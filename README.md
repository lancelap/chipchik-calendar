The demo constructs Google Calendar Event URLs without needing to put an event in your own calendar. It basically just stuffs the details you enter below into a google.com/calendar/event with all the correct parameter encoding. You can then put the link in an email or a website. Other people can then use the link to create the event in their own Google Calendar.
